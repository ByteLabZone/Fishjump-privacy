    <h1>Privacy Policy for Fish Game</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> March 15, 2025</p>
    <p>Welcome to the Fish Jump Game! We value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.</p>
    
    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>Fish Game collects minimal data to enhance your gaming experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High Score:</strong> We store your high score locally on your device using UserDefaults. This allows us to display your best performance across game sessions. This data is not linked to your identity (such as your name or email) and remains solely on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No other personal information, such as your name, location, or device identifiers, is collected by the Fish Jump Game. We do not use analytics tools, advertising networks, or any features that transmit data off your device.</p>
    
    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>The high score data is used exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Track and display your best performance within the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is not shared with third parties, used for tracking across apps, or transmitted to our servers or any external entity.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your high score is stored locally on your device and is only accessible to the Fish Jump Game. It remains on your device unless you uninstall the app, at which point it may be deleted depending on your deviceâ€™s settings.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally, you have full control over it. You can reset your high score by uninstalling and reinstalling the app, which will clear the stored data.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. Please check back periodically for updates.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:ByteLabZone@proton.me">ByteLabZone@proton.me</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for playing the Fish Jump Game!</p>
